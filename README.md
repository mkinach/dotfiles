# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles (and other configs) to get up-and-running on a new machine.

To use, clone this repo and then run `./install.sh` followed by `./setup.sh`.

### TO-DO:
* organize `i3` configs with include directives once distro repos update `i3` to version 4.20+
* set up logging for `install.sh`
