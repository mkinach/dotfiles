# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles (and other configs) to get up-and-running on a new machine.

To build the Apptainer image: run `./build.sh`.

To set up locally: run `./install.sh` followed by `./setup.sh`.

To set up remotely: run `./install.sh` outside the Apptainer image followed by `./setup.sh` inside the Apptainer image.
